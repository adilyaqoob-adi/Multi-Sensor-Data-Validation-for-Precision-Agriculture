Project Title: Multi-Sensor Data Validation for Precision Agriculture

Objective: To validate a 2,200-sample sensor dataset for agricultural reliability.

Validation Steps: * Confirmed zero missing values and duplicates.

Verified sensor readings against biological limits (e.g., pH 3.5–9.9).

Key Insight: Discovered a 0.74 correlation between Phosphorus and Potassium, identifying a key nutrient dependency for fertilizer planning.

Actionable Recommendation: "Crops like Papaya require strict pH monitoring (6.5–7.0), whereas Mothbeans are suitable for reclaimed acidic or alkaline lands.
